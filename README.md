# Rest-Counter

# The app allows the user to manually input a specified bpm (beats per minute) and a meter (4/4 or 3/4 etc.). Once you press start, the app will then begin counting bars, according to your desired bpm and meter, and display the amount of bars counted on the screen. In the future, I hope to add a function where you can tap your desired meter.
