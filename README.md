# Rest-Counter

# Since I was 2, I've been a musician. Initally, I started playing piano, I played the bass for a while, but in grade 7, I picked up the trumpet. Initally, we played a lot, being the melody, but eventually, when we swithed over to an Orchestra setting (combined winds and strings), we found ourselves doing less and less. Me and my friend would often joke that we needed some sort of automated way to count all of our rests, since we had so many. Though I've now graduated, this is my attempt to do so. The app allows the user to manually input a specified bpm (beats per minute) and a meter (4/4 or 3/4 etc.). Once you press start, the app will then begin counting bars, according to your desired bpm and meter, and display the amount of bars counted on the screen. In the future, I hope to add a function where you can tap your desired meter.
